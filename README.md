# AlbumArtCssProject

## Welcome!

Thanks for stopping by and checking out my artwork.

My name is Alexander. I'm a frontend engineer. I really enjoy art history and graphi design. Sometimes when I get stressy spaghetti, I like to listen to very chill music -- think, vaporwave, chill wave, chill anime beats, etc. Recently, I've found some great artists that i've been vibing with so in a way to challenge myself and keeping my css skills sharp, im trying to recreate some of their albium covers.

## The Specs

Nothing fancy folks. I just use HTML / CSS for everything. They're definitely not perfect, but it's just a way to practice new design techniques and have fun. This is truly just a hobby project. Also they're mobile responsive!!!!

## How To Navigate

I'm trying to figure out the best way to keep everything in one place so I think, for the time being, I'm going to create a new folder for each album cover. If you'd like to see the artwork...

    1. cd into portfolio
    2. in the terminal run npm start

## Music Credit

Below are the links to the videos I listen to. Give them a listen! They're absolutely brilliant for coding background music.
